### Line Chart

Line charts are best used to express changes in a metric across time, or progress across a series of stages. This example uses a series to display four different metrics at the same time – each as a different colored line.

### Area Chart

Like line charts, area charts can also be used for expressing changes in a metric across time. Unlike line charts, area charts shade the area beneath the lines that represent metric values so that you can more readily compare data magnitudes.

### Scatter Chart

Scatter charts are useful for analyzing trends between two metrics — one along each axis — or for simply tracking the magnitude of two metrics from the same chart.

### Bubble Chart

Bubble charts are similar to scatter plots but offer an added functionality – the size of the plotted points can be set to change in proportion to the magnitude of a third metric.

### Bar Chart

Bar charts allow you to visually compare discrete categories of data. Horizontal charts focus more on categories which are compared, and vertical (also called column charts) are more about the data.

### Stacked Bar Chart

Stacked Bar charts are similar to bar charts but offer a glimpse into the composite categories that make up each bar.

### Pie Chart

Pie charts allow viewers to visualize component parts of a whole. If your aim is to accurately compare the component parts of your chart, be careful! The relative size of pie and donut slices can be hard to discern, so a bar chart might be your best option.

Info: </br>
Matplotlib: Matplotlib is mainly deployed for basic plotting. Visualization using Matplotlib generally consists of bars, pies, lines, scatter plots and so on. </br> Seaborn: Seaborn, on the other hand, provides a variety of visualization patterns. It uses fewer syntax and has easily interesting default themes.
